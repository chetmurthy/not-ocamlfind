not-ocamlfind 0.14

  to hopefully work well on Windows.

not-ocamlfind 0.13
------------------

* [3 May 2024] add "-impl", "-intf" to the "preprocess" command (pass
  thru to camlp5).  Also fix Freebsd build process.

not-ocamlfind 0.12
------------------

* [22 Sep 2023] change bootstrap in Makefile to avoid freebsd build bug

not-ocamlfind 0.11
------------------

* [30 Aug 2023] swap "bash" to "sh"

not-ocamlfind 0.10
------------------

* [30 Mar 2023] in "preprocess", ignore "-for-pack", "-linkall" arguments so we can just replace "ocamlc" with "preprocess"

not-ocamlfind 0.08
------------------

* [04 Aug 2021] add better support for syntax predicates.  

  formerly, a syntax predicate gets added to "syntax_preds".

  with this patch, "syntax_" prepended to that predicate also gets
  added to "predicates".

not-ocamlfind 0.07.02
---------------------

* [26 Oct 2020] remove dependencies on sexp (too many deps) since they were for debug only

not-ocamlfind 0.07.01
---------------------

* [13 Oct 2020] added a changelog

  minor fix for ocamlgraph 2.0.0 compatibility.  Since ocamlgraph
  1.8.8->2.0.0 is a breaking change, this version of not-ocamlfind
  will only work with the newer version of ocamlgraph.
