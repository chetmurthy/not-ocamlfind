not-ocamlfind 0.08
---------------------

* [04 Aug 2021] add better support for syntax predicates.  

  formerly, a syntax predicate gets added to "syntax_preds".

  with this patch, "syntax_" prepended to that predicate also gets
  added to "predicates".

not-ocamlfind 0.07.02
---------------------

* [26 Oct 2020] remove dependencies on sexp (too many deps) since they were for debug only

not-ocamlfind 0.07.01
---------------------

* [13 Oct 2020] added a changelog

  minor fix for ocamlgraph 2.0.0 compatibility.  Since ocamlgraph
  1.8.8->2.0.0 is a breaking change, this version of not-ocamlfind
  will only work with the newer version of ocamlgraph.
